### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh. I've been working as a SWE for the last decade mostly focussed on backend infrastructure and foundational work. I currently work for Stripe where I am focussed on improving the scalability, reliability, efficiency, and operational excellence of their 12k+ node MongoDB fleet.

I have a T-shaped skillset:
* My depth is in Ruby, Golang, Erlang/Elixir, backend services, and [CP-style](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-cap-theorem-trade-offs-different-types-databases-roshan/) databases.
* Below is a complete list of technologies which I've used and maintained in production (in no particular order):
  * Front-end technologies (React, Angular, Backbone, SASS)
  * Serving infrastructure (httpd, nginx, envoy, consul, Docker, Kubernetes, daemontools)
  * Cloud tooling and services (AWS, statsd, Honeycomb, Prometheus, Splunk)
  * CP-style databases (MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Postgres)
  * NoSQL databases (Redis, Cassandra)
  * Data processing frameworks (Temporal, Hadoop)
  * Programming languages (Ruby, Golang, Erlang/Elixir, Python, Java, C, C++, Bash)
  * And some specialty tools (perf, eBPF, ffmpeg, ImageMagick)
 
While I don't do as many projects in my spare time as I used to, over the past couple of years I've:
* Authored a [spying/stubbing library](https://github.com/jbodah/spy_rb) for testing Ruby code
* Maintained the [canonical vim language plugin](https://github.com/elixir-editors/vim-elixir) for the [Elixir programming language](https://elixir-lang.org/)
* Wrote a [game](https://github.com/jbodah/game_jam-locked) for a Game Jam (which you can [play here](https://jbodah.itch.io/admin-play)!)
* Developed a [toolkit](https://github.com/jbodah/bgg_tools) for analyzing data from and automating workflows related to [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/)
* Built a [simulator](https://github.com/jbodah/metro_x_map_generator) for the board game [Metro X](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/248861/metro-x)
* Created a [simple program](https://github.com/jbodah/mosaic) which can produce [photo mosaics](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=photo+mosaics)
