### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh. I've been working as a SWE for the last decade mostly focussed on backend infrastructure and foundational work. I currently work for Stripe where I am focussed on improving the scalability, reliability, efficiency, and operational standards regarding their massive MongoDB fleet.
